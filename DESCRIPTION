Description: seqClustR package provides the means to generate and extract 
    clusters from sequence data using different clustering algorithms. By 
    passing the data in a specific format you could try out different 
    clustering algorithms on your sequence data at one place which would save
    some time and effort required to prepare data for each algorithm.
